// Graphs are a data structure that consists of a finite set of nodes and edges.
// There are many different types of graphs, but the two most common ones you'll see are directed and undirected graphs.
// In a directed graph, edges have direction. In an undirected graph, edges do not have direction.

// you work for a professional social network. in this social network, a professional
// can follow other people to see their updates (think Twitter for professionals.)
// write a function that finds the job `title` that shows up most frequently given
// a set of degree of separation from you. count the initial id's own job title in the total
